### **Joshua Clegg - Data Scientist**
I am a data scientist coming from a pharmaceutical background hoping to develop my career in tech. I possess skills in data analysis, data visualisation, forecasting and providing key insights into data. I have over 5 years of experience with Excel and have proficiency with SQL and python for data analysis and visualisation.
I am also skilled in using machine learning techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning to create key data models that provide significant insight.
My educational background is in STEM, graduating with a 2:1 in my double major degree which focused on Computer Science and Chemistry.
I have completed a highly intensive Data Science Bootcamp sponsored by the Dfe and have received certification as a data scientist from a Russell Group University and HyperionDev, the bootcamp provider. I seek to put the skills I learned from it to delve into an appropriate tech role.
